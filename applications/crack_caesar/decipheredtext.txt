WHISTLING AFTER ROBINIT WAS WELL FOR ROBIN HOOD THAT THAT SAME FORESTERS HEAD WAS SPINNING WITH ALE OR ELSE HE WOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN ANOTHER STEP AS IT WAS THE ARROW WHISTLED WITHIN THREE INCHES OF

LOCKSLEY TOWN FOR HE WAS OUTLAWED NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE HAD KILLED A MAN BUT ALSO BECAUSE HE HAD POACHED UPON THE KINGS DEER AND TWO HUNDRED POUNDS WERE SET UPON HIS HEAD AS A REWARD FOR WHOEVER WOULD BRING HIM TO THE COURT OF THE KINGNOW THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM SWORE THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BRING THIS KNAVE ROBIN HOOD TO XUSTICE AND FOR TWO REASONS FIRST BECAUSE HE WANTED THE TWO HUNDRED POUNDS AND NEJT BECAUSE THE FORESTER THAT ROBIN HOOD HAD KILLED WAS OF KIN TO HIMBUT ROBIN HOOD LAY HIDDEN IN SHERWOOD FOREST FOR ONE YEAR AND IN THAT TIME THERE GATHERED AROUND HIM MANY OTHERS LIKE HIMSELF CAST OUT FROM OTHER FOLK FOR THIS CAUSE AND FOR THAT SOME HAD SHOT DEER IN HUNGRY WINTERTIME WHEN THEY COULD GET NO OTHER FOOD AND HAD BEEN SEEN IN THE ACT BY THE FORESTERS BUT HAD ESCAPED THUS SAVING THEIR EARS SOME HAD BEEN TURNED OUT OF THEIR INHERITANCE THAT THEIR FARMS MIGHT BE ADDED TO THE KINGS LANDS IN SHERWOOD FOREST SOME HAD BEEN DESPOILED BY A GREAT BARON OR A RICH ABBOT OR A POWERFUL ESQUIREALL FOR ONE CAUSE OR ANOTHER HAD COME TO SHERWOOD TO ESCAPE WRONG AND OPPRESSIONSO IN ALL THAT YEAR FIVESCORE OR MORE GOOD STOUT YEOMEN GATHERED ABOUT ROBIN HOOD AND CHOSE HIM TO BE THEIR
